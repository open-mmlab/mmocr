Abstract: 'Pursuing accurate and robust recognizers has been a longlasting goal
for scene text recognition (STR) researchers. Recently, attention-based methods
have demonstrated their effectiveness and achieved impressive results on public
benchmarks. The attention mechanism enables models to recognize scene text with
severe visual distortions by leveraging contextual information. However, recent
studies revealed that the implicit over-reliance of context leads to catastrophic
out-ofvocabulary performance. On the contrary to the superior accuracy of the
seen text, models are prone to misrecognize unseen text even with good image
quality. We propose a novel framework, Context-based contrastive learning
(ConCLR), to alleviate this issue. Our proposed method first generates
characters with different contexts via simple image concatenation operations
and then optimizes contrastive loss on their embeddings. By pulling together
clusters of identical characters within various contexts and pushing apart
clusters of different characters in embedding space, ConCLR suppresses the
side-effect of overfitting to specific contexts and learns a more robust
representation. Experiments show that ConCLR significantly improves
out-of-vocabulary generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks together with attention-based recognizers.'
