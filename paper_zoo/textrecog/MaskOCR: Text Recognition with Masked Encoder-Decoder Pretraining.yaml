Abstract: 'In this paper, we present a model pretraining technique, named
MaskOCR, for text recognition. Our text recognition architecture is an
encoder-decoder transformer: the encoder extracts the patch-level
representations, and the decoder recognizes the text from the representations.
Our approach pretrains both the encoder and the decoder in a sequential manner.
(i) We pretrain the encoder in a self-supervised manner over a large set of
unlabeled real text images. We adopt the masked image modeling approach, which
shows the effectiveness for general images, expecting that the representations
take on semantics. (ii) We pretrain the decoder over a large set of synthesized
text images in a supervised manner and enhance the language modeling capability
of the decoder by randomly masking some text image patches occupied by
characters input to the encoder and accordingly the representations input to
the decoder. Experiments show that the proposed MaskOCR approach achieves
superior results on the benchmark datasets, including Chinese and English text
images.'
