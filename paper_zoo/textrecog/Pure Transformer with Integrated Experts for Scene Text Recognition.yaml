Abstract: 'Scene text recognition (STR) involves the task of reading text in
cropped images of natural scenes. Conventional models in STR employ
convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by recurrent neural network in an
encoder-decoder framework. In recent times, the transformer architecture is
being widely adopted in STR as it shows strong capability in capturing
long-term dependency which appears to be prominent in scene text images. Many
researchers utilized transformer as part of a hybrid CNN-transformer encoder,
often followed by a transformer decoder. However, such methods only make use
of the long-term dependency mid-way through the encoding process. Although the
vision transformer (ViT) is able to capture such dependency at an early stage,
its utilization remains largely unexploited in STR. This work proposes the use
of a transformer-only model as a simple baseline which outperforms hybrid
CNN-transformer models. Furthermore, two key areas for improvement were
identified. Firstly, the first decoded character has the lowest prediction
accuracy. Secondly, images of different original aspect ratios react
differently to the patch resolutions while ViT only employ one fixed patch
resolution. To explore these areas, Pure Transformer with Integrated Experts
(PTIE) is proposed. PTIE is a transformer model that can process multiple patch
resolutions and decode in both the original and reverse character orders. It is
examined on 7 commonly used benchmarks and compared with over 20
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms them and obtains state-of-the-art results in most
benchmarks.'
