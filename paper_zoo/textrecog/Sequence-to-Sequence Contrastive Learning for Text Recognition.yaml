Abstract: 'We propose a framework for sequence-to-sequence contrastive learning
(SeqCLR) of visual representations, which we apply to text recognition. To
account for the sequenceto-sequence structure, each feature map is divided
into different instances over which the contrastive loss is computed. This
operation enables us to contrast in a sub-word level, where from each image
we extract several positive pairs and multiple negative examples. To yield
effective visual representations for text recognition, we further suggest
novel augmentation heuristics, different encoder architectures and custom
projection heads. Experiments on handwritten text and on scene text show that
when a text decoder is trained on the learned representations, our method
outperforms non-sequential contrastive methods. In addition, when the amount
of supervision is reduced, SeqCLR significantly improves performance compared
with supervised training, and when fine-tuned with 100% of the labels, our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on standard handwritten text
recognition benchmarks.'
