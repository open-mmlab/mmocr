Abstract: 'In this paper, we abandon the dominant complex language model and
rethink the linguistic learning process in the scene text recognition. Different
from previous methods considering the visual and linguistic information in two
separate structures, we propose a Visual Language Modeling Network (VisionLAN),
which views the visual and linguistic information as a union by directly enduing
the vision model with language capability. Specially, we introduce the text
recognition of character-wise occluded feature maps in the training stage. Such
operation guides the vision model to use not only the visual texture of
characters, but also the linguistic information in visual context for
recognition when the visual cues are confused (e.g. occlusion, noise, etc.).
As the linguistic information is acquired along with visual features without
the need of extra language model, VisionLAN significantly improves the speed
by 39% and adaptively considers the linguistic information to enhance the visual
features for accurate recognition. Furthermore, an Occlusion Scene Text (OST)
dataset is proposed to evaluate the performance on the case of missing
characterwise visual cues. The state of-the-art results on several benchmarks
prove our effectiveness. Code and dataset are available at
