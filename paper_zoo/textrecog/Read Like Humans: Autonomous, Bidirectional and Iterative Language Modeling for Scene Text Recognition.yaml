Abstract: 'Reading irregular scene text of arbitrary shape in natural images is
still a challenging problem, despite the progress made recently. Many existing
approaches incorporate sophisticated network structures to handle various shapes,
use extra annotations for stronger supervision, or employ hard-to-train recurrent
neural networks for sequence modeling. In this work, we propose a simple yet
strong approach for scene text recognition. With no need to convert input images
to sequence representations, we directly connect two-dimensional CNN features
to an attention-based sequence decoder which guided by holistic representation.
The holistic representation can guide the attention-based decoder focus on more
accurate area. As no recurrent module is adopted, our model can be trained in
parallel. It achieves 1:5 to 9:4 acceleration to backward pass and 1:3 to
7:9 acceleration to forward pass, compared with the RNN counterparts. The
proposed model is trained with only word-level annotations. With this simple
design, our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive recognition
performance on the evaluated regular and irregular scene text benchmark
datasets.'
